## üå± Inspiration

The Smart Resilience Hub was born from the belief that students and young innovators can play a transformative role in solving global health crises by connecting technology, equity, and governance. This vision was shaped through a series of policy submissions:

- **2022:** [Letter to the Hon‚Äôble President of India](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTa_S0kUq_1iuqO7aSCZCy49edGRcSfc/view?usp=drive_link) on poverty and hunger (SDG 1 & 2)
- **2023:** [G20 Development Working Group Submission](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K5F8HfLMs31UE_OBVqCJRUmylpU-Uy9L/view?usp=drive_link) on affordable agri-tech (SDG 2 & 3)
- **2023:** [Mann Ki Baat 100th Episode Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CQIxFkSEyfbKxlXh-RCmOFTNj94F807w/view?usp=drive_link) on governance accountability (SDG 16)

These experiences taught us that youth-driven innovation, aligned with ESG principles and the UN SDGs, can translate policy into practical, scalable solutions for global health equity.
